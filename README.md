# This is a code for quiz app

In this app I ahve used MVC architecture and devide the code respectively and they are strored in the following folders
- Item 2
  - Subitem 1
  - Subitem 2
  - Utill

 In Controller we call the respective functions we require
 In Routes we declare the routes or API aand which route should use which Controller
 In Utill all the logic part is done

 In the main code i.e quix.js we just give the routes

 ```
 const app = express()
const routes = express.Router()
```
We use express framework for this project
